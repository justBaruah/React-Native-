## For App.js
### Import Statements
- `import React from "react";`: Imports the React library to use in the app.
- `import { StyleSheet, Text, View, Button, Alert, Linking, ActivityIndicator, ScrollView, FlatList, } from "react-native";`: Imports components and APIs from the `react-native` library.

### App Component
- `export default function App() {`: Defines the main app component that React Native will render.

### Data Array
- `const DATA = [...];`: Defines an array of objects, each representing a Maratha warrior with `ID` and `Name` properties.

### handlePress Function
- `const handlePress = () => {`: Defines a function that is called when the button is pressed.
    - `console.log("Button Clicked");`: Logs a message to the console.
    - `Alert.alert(...);`: Displays an alert with options to learn more about Shivaji Maharaj and the Maratha Wars.

### renderItem Function
- `const renderItem = ({ item }) => ( ... );`: Defines how each item in the `DATA` array is rendered.

### Return Statement
- `return ( ... );`: Returns the JSX that describes the app's UI.

### View Component
- `<View style={styles.container}>`: A container that uses the `container` style.

### Button and Text for Tribute
- `Text` and `Button` components are used to display a message and a button. The button, when pressed, triggers the `handlePress` function.

### FlatList Component
- `<FlatList ... />`: Renders a list of items horizontally from the `DATA` array.

### Commented ScrollView Components
- `{/* <ScrollView ... */}`: These commented lines show alternative ways to render the list using `ScrollView` instead of `FlatList`.

### Commented ActivityIndicator Component
- `{/* <ActivityIndicator ... /> */}`: This commented line shows how an `ActivityIndicator` could be added to indicate loading.

### Styles
- `const styles = StyleSheet.create({ ... });`: Defines the styles used in the app. Includes styles for the container, titles, and more.

### Note on Style Properties
- Note that some style properties are duplicated or might not correctly reflect their intended use, such as the duplicated `backgroundColor` in `styles.container`.
